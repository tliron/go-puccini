Clout
=====

Introducing the **clou**d **t**opology ("clou" + "t") representation language, which is, simply put,
a straightforward and rather generic graph database stored as
["agnostic raw data"](https://github.com/tliron/go-kutil/tree/master/ard/), in YAML, JSON, XML, or CBOR.
By default it will be in YAML.

Clout functions as the intermediary format for your deployments. As an analogy, consider a program
written in the C language. First, you must *compile* the C source into machine code for your
hardware architecture. Then, you *link* the compiled object, together with various libraries, into a
deployable executable for a specific target platform. Clout is the compiled object in this analogy.

If you only care about the final result then you won't see the Clout at all. However, the decoupling
allows for a more powerful toolchain. For example, some tools might change your Clout after the
initial compilation (to scale out, to optimize, to add platform hooks, debugging features, etc.) and
then you just need to "re-link" in order to update your deployment. This can happen without
requiring you to update your original source design. It may also possible to "de-compile" some cloud
deployments so that you can generate a Clout without any TOSCA "source code".


Design Principles
-----------------

Clout is essentially a big, unopinionated, implementation-specific dump of vertexes and the edges
between them with un-typed, non-validated properties.

In itself Clout is an unremarkable format. Think of it as a way to gather various deployment
specifications for disparate technologies in one place while allowing for the *relationships*
(edges) between entities to be specified and annotated. That's the topology.

Clout is not supposed to be human-readable or human-manageable. The idea is to use tools (Clout
frontends and processors) to deal with its complexity. For example, with Puccini you can use just
a little bit of TOSCA to generate a single big Clout file that describes a complex Kubernetes
service mesh.

Rule #1 of Clout is that everything and the kitchen sink should be in one Clout file. Really, anything
goes: specifications, configurations, metadata, annotations, source code, documentation, and even
text-encoded binaries. (The only exception might be that security certificates and keys are best stored
in a separate vault.)


Storage
-------

Orchestrators may choose to store Clout opaquely, as is, in a key-value database or filesystem.
This could work well because cloud deployments change infrequently: often all that's needed is to
retrieve a Clout, parse and lookup data, and possibly update a TOSCA attribute and store it again.
Iterating many Clouts in sequence this way could be done quickly enough even for large
environments. Simple solutions are often best.

That said, it could also make sense to store Clout data in a graph database. This would allow for
sophisticated queries, using languages such [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and
[Gremlin](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html), as well as localized transactional updates.
This approach could be especially useful for highly composable and dynamic environments in which
Clouts combine together to form larger topologies and even relate to data coming from other systems.

Graph databases are quite diverse in features and Clout is very flexible, so one schema will not
fit all. Puccini instead comes with examples: see [storing in Neo4j](examples/neo4j/) and
[storing in Dgraph](examples/dgraph/).


Structure
---------

Note that *all* map keys in Clout must be strings. This is in order to ensure widest compatibility
with programming languages and implementations.

### `version` (string)

Must be "1.0" to conform with this document.

### `metadata` (map of string to anything)

General metadata for the whole topology. It may include information about which frontend or
processor generated the Clout file, a timestamp, etc.

### `properties` (map of string to anything)

General implementation-specific properties for the whole topology.

The difference between `metadata` and `properties` is a matter of convention. Generally, `properties`
should be used for data that is implementation-specific while `metadata` should be used for tooling.
It is understood that this distinction might not always be clear and thus you should not treat the
two areas differently in terms of state management.

### `vertexes` (map of string to Vertex)

It is **very important** that you *do not treat the keys of this map as data*, for example as the
unique name of a vertex. If you need a "name" for the vertex, it should be a property within the
vertex. The vertex map keys are an internal implementation detail of Clout.

The reason for this is critical to Clout's intended use. The vertex key is used *only* as a way to
map the topology internally within an instance of Clout. More specifically, it is used for the
`targetID` field in an edge so that the topology can graphed.

But a Clout processor may very well transform a Clout file and modify the topology. This could
involve adding new vertexes and edges or moving them around, for example to optimize a topology,
to heal a broken implementation, to scale out an overloaded system, etc. In doing so it may
regenerate these IDs. These IDs need only be unique to one specific Clout file, not generally.

If you do need to lookup a vertex by, say, its `name` property, then the correct way to do so is to
iterate through all vertexes and look for the first vertex that has that particular name. Indeed, it
is reasonable for Clout parsers to entirely hide these IDs from the user and perhaps represent the
vertex map as a list.


Vertex
------

### `metadata` (map of string to anything)

The convention is that each application will have its own key under `metadata`. Often you'll find
information here about what kind of vertex this is, e.g. a TOSCA node:

```yaml
metadata:
  puccini:
    kind: NodeTemplate
    version: "1.0"
```

### `properties` (map of string to anything)

Implementation-specific properties for the vertex. For example, a TOSCA NodeTemplate would have
these:

```yaml
artifacts: {}
attributes: {}
capabilities: {}
description: ""
directives: []
interfaces: {}
metadata: {}
name: "my-node-template"
properties: {}
requirements: []
types: {}
```

### `edgesOut` (list of Edge)

Clout edges are directional, though you may choose to semantically ignore the direction. The edges
are stored in the *source* vertex, which is why this field is named `edgesOut`.

As a convenience, Clout parsers may very well add an in-memory `edgesIn` field, which would also be
a list of edges, after mapping the `targetID` fields of all edges to vertexes, or otherwise provide
a tool for looking up edges for which a certain vertex is a target.


Edge
----

### `metadata` (map of string to anything)

Often you'll find information here about what kind of edge this is, e.g. a TOSCA relationship:

```yaml
metadata:
  puccini:
    kind: Relationship
    version: "1.0"
```

### `properties` (map of string to anything)

Implementation-specific properties for the edge, e.g. for a TOSCA relationship:

```yaml
attributes: {}
capability: "socket"
description: ""
interfaces: {}
name: "plug"
properties: {}
types: {}
```

### `targetID` (string)

The key in the vertexes map to which this edge is the target.

Note that there is no need for a `sourceID` because the edge is already located in the `edgesOut`
field of its source vertex. Clout parsers may very well add such a field for convenience.

Also, Clout parsers may do the ID lookup internally, provide direct access to the source and
target vertexes, and hide the `targetID` field.


Values
------

A common feature in many Clout use cases is the inclusion of values that are meant to be "coerced"
at runtime. Coercion could include evaluating an expression containing functions, testing for validity
of the value by applying functions, calling a conversion function, etc.

Clout does not enforce a notation for such coercible values, however we do suggest a convention.
Puccini comes with tools to help you parse according to this notation and to perform coercion using
JavaScript.

The convention assumes that a value is a map with at least one *and only one* of the following
fields:

* `$primitive`: This is an ARD literal value (boolean, integer, float, string, list, map, etc.),
  or a special primitive type expressed with an extended map notation.
* `$list`: This is an ARD list of coercible values (recursive).
* `$map`: This is an ARD *list* of map entries (not a map!), in which each entry is a coercible value
   (recursive) with the addition of a `$key` field, which is itself also a coercible value (recursive).
   Note that a `$map` can be the result of either a map type or a struct (e.g. a complex data type
   in TOSCA). For structs, see `fields` in `$meta` below.
* `$functionCall`: This is a function call.

Values may also have the following optional fields:

* `$meta`: a map with metadata about the value (see below)
* `$converter`: a `$functionaCall` called after coersion is completed to convert the value to
  anything else

For special primitive types `$primitive` is a map with fields specific to that type as well as
the following optional fields:

* `$string`: textual representation of the value for human-readability, comparison, sorting, etc.
* `$number`: numeric representation of the value (float or integer) for comparison, sorting, etc.
* `$originalString`: if the value was parsed from a string then this would be that string
* `$comparer`: a `$functioncall` value for comparisons, which receives two arguments and returns
   0 if equal, -1 if the first argument is greater, and 1 if the second argument is greater

`$functionCall` is a map with the following required fields:

* `name`: a string representing the name of the function
* `arguments`: a list of coercible values (can be an empty list but not null)

It may also have the follow optional fields for debugging information:

* `path`: a string representing a semantic path within the source document (implementation-specific)
* `url`: a string representing the URL of the source document
* `row`: an integer representing the row within the source document
* `column`: an integer representing the column within the source document

`$meta` is a map with the following fields, all of which are optional:

* `type`: name of the value's type
* `element`: meta (recursive) for `$list` elements
* `key`: meta (recursive) for `$map` keys, if not a struct
* `value`: meta (recursive) for `$map` values, if not a struct
* `fields`: a map of field names to their meta (recursive), for `$map` structs
* `validators`: a list of `$functionCall` which accept the value as their first argument, all
  of which must return true for the value to be valid (logical "and")
* `description`: a human-readable description of the variable to which this value is assigned
* `typeDescription`: a human-readable description of the value's type
* `localDescription`: a human-readable description of the value itself
* `metadata`: a map of strings associated with the variable to which this value is assigned
* `typeMetadata`: a map of strings associated with the value's type
* `localMetadata`: a map of strings associated with the value itself
